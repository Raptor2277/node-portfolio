    summary = 'As I learned more about OpenGL, I wanted to expand on what I\'ve learned and make something
    bigger. I didn\'t want to start another game so I decided I would make a solar system simulator. 
    I\'ve worked on this project for 2 semesters and have learned a great deal about OpenGL.
    I\'ve learned how to implement ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting, how to use specular and 
    transparency maps and much more. I have also implemented my own GUI
    libary that uses core OpenGL for drawing controls.'

    summary = 'A side-project that simulates a 3x3 Rubik\'s Cube. It uses a 
    java based solver to solve the cube in a minimal set of moves. The user uses
    the keyboard to rotate the faces of the cube and has the option to let the
    solver solve the scrambled cube.'
